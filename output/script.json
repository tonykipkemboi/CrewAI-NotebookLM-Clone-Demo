  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Hey, Giggles! Yeah, black holes are indeed mind-blowing. And what's crazy is that they're not just these rare, exotic objects. They're actually pretty common."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "Whoa, really? That's not what I expected. I mean, I thought black holes were like, super rare and only found in certain parts of the universe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Nope! According to the latest estimates, there are over 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe, and each one of those galaxies is thought to have a giant black hole at its center. That's a lot of black holes!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "That is a lot of black holes! And these giant black holes, how big are they exactly? You mentioned they're giant, but what does that even mean?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Well, these supermassive black holes can have masses millions or even billions of times that of our sun. It's hard to wrap your head around, but they're truly gargantuan objects."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "That's... just... wow. And what about these stellar-sized black holes? Are they smaller versions of the supermassive ones?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Exactly! Stellar-sized black holes are formed when individual stars collapse in on themselves. They're much smaller than the supermassive ones, but still pack a lot of gravitational punch."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "I see. And you said there are about 100 million of these stellar-sized black holes in each galaxy? That's just... uh... a lot of holes in space!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Ha! Yeah, it is a lot of holes in space. But think about it, Giggles - that means there are approximately 10 billion billion black holes in the observable universe. That's a 1 followed by 19 zeros!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "Whoa... my brain just exploded. And, umm, you said that, far into the future, black holes will be all that's left? What does that even mean?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Well, in about 40 billion years, the universe will be three times its current age, and all the stars will have burned out. According to the calculations of astrophysicists Fred Adams and Gregory Laughlin, at that point, the only objects left in the universe will be black holes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "That's... that's just... so profound. It's like, the ultimate cosmic legacy. Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us, Chuckles."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Anytime, Giggles! It's always a blast to talk about mind-bending topics like black holes. Maybe next time we can explore more cosmic curiosities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "Sounds like a plan, Chuckles! And that's all the time we have for today. Thanks for tuning in to Brainy Banter, folks! Join us next time for more brain-tickling conversations."
