    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "I know, Chuckles! I've always been curious about these cosmic phenomena. Let's start with the basics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "So, I heard that black holes are actually pretty common in the universe. Is that true?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Yeah, that's right. Astrophysicists believe that giant black holes are at the center of almost every large galaxy. And we're not just talking about a few, we're talking about billions of galaxies, each with millions of stellar-sized black holes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "Whoa, that's mind-blowing! So, what's the estimated total number of black holes out there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Well, according to estimates, there are over 200 billion galaxies, each with about 100 million stellar-sized black holes. That adds up to..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "Wait, let me guess... a really big number?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Ha! Yeah, you could say that. The estimated total number of black holes is on the order of 10^19, or 10 billion billion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "10 billion billion?! That's a number that's hard to even wrap your head around. What's the significance of that number, Chuckles?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Well, it just goes to show how ubiquitous black holes are in the universe. And it's not just about the number, it's also about their role in shaping the universe as we know it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "That's so cool. And I heard that in the distant future, black holes will be all that's left. Is that true?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "Yeah, that's right. According to an analysis by astrophysicists Fred Adams and Gregory Laughlin, in about 40 billion years, the universe will be a very different place, and black holes will be the only stellar-like objects remaining."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "Wow, that's a pretty sobering thought. But also kind of fascinating. I mean, can you imagine a universe where the only things left are black holes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "It's definitely a thought-provoking idea. And it just goes to show how much we still have to learn about the universe and its many mysteries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Giggles",
    "text": "Absolutely. Well, I think we've just scratched the surface of this fascinating topic. Thanks for joining me on this journey into the world of black holes, Chuckles!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Chuckles",
    "text": "My pleasure, Giggles. It's always fun to explore the unknown with you."
